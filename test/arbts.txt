# **Asian Range Breakout Strategy for Gold (MGC) – Detailed Technical Specification Document**

## **Version:** 1.0

## **Prepared For:** Futures Trading using MGC via TopStepX Data

## **Asset:** Micro Gold Futures (MGC)

## **Goal:** Build, test, and validate the Asian Range Breakout Strategy specifically for MGC using TopStep data for the current year.

---

# **1. Introduction**

Gold exhibits highly predictable session-based volatility behavior. The **Asian Range Breakout Strategy** takes advantage of the consistent low-volatility consolidation period during the Asian session and the explosive volatility expansion during the London and New York sessions.

This document provides:

* Full behavioral analysis of gold and why the strategy works
* Exact strategy rules (entries, exits, risk, filters)
* A step-by-step engineering plan to build the backtester
* A blueprint for pulling historical MGC data from TopStepX API
* Data cleaning and preprocessing procedures
* Backtesting logic and statistical evaluation methodology
* A technical plan for future live trading integration

All logic follows the strategy description **exactly as originally defined**, with no deviations.

# **2. Why This Strategy Works (Market Microstructure Explanation)**

### **2.1 Asian Session Behavior (8 PM – 2 AM ET)**

* Low liquidity
* Low volatility
* Minimal institutional activity
* Price consolidates into a narrow and stable range
* This creates a **liquidity box**, where both retail and institutional orders accumulate

Large liquidity builds up:

* Above Asian range high (buy stops)
* Below Asian range low (sell stops)

This builds **stored potential energy**.

### **2.2 London Open (3 AM ET)**

* European banks and bullion desks come online
* Liquidity jumps dramatically
* A predictable volatility expansion begins
* Price seeks liquidity → breakout from the Asian box

### **2.3 New York Session (8:30 AM – 12 PM ET)**

* COMEX opens → largest gold futures volume in the world
* Gold tends to continue the initial breakout direction
* Liquidity is strong and clean until around 12 PM ET

---

# **3. Strategy Rules (Strict and Unmodified)**

## **3.1 Time Windows**

* **Asian Session Range:** 8:00 PM – 2:00 AM ET
* **London Open Trigger:** 3:00 AM ET
* **NY Close for Strategy Exit:** 12:00 PM ET

---

# **3.2 Asian Range Construction (Core Component)**

Between 8 PM and 2 AM ET:

* Track all high and low prices
* At 2 AM, freeze the **Asian High** and **Asian Low**

We now have a full **range box**.

---

# **3.3 Pending Orders at 3:00 AM ET (London Open)**

Place two OCO (one-cancels-other) orders:

### **Buy Stop:**

* Price = Asian High + 1 minimum tick

### **Sell Stop:**

* Price = Asian Low − 1 minimum tick

-

Only one of these should trigger.
*

---

# **3.4 Position Management**

### **Stop Loss (SL):**

Opposite side of the Asian Range:

* Long trade → stop below Asian Low
* Short trade → stop above Asian High

### **Take Profit (TP):**

1× to 2× Asian Range size

* Range = Asian High − Asian Low
* TP = Entry + (1R to 2R move)

### **Break-Even Rule:**

When trade reaches **+1R profit**:

* Move the stop loss to break-even

### **Hard Exit Time:**

If TP not hit before **12 PM ET**, exit immediately.

# **4. Engineering Plan – Building the System**

This section outlines exactly how to build the codebase to test the strategy.

---

# **4.1 Data Acquisition (TopStepX)**

### **4.1.1 Required Data Fields**

To backtest for the year, we must obtain MGC data containing:

* Timestamp (in ET)
* Open
* High
* Low
* Close
* Volume

### **4.1.2 Data Frequency**

For accuracy: **1-minute bars**

Lower timeframes (e.g., tick) can be used later, but 1-minute is sufficient for this strategy.

### **4.1.3 API Retrieval Steps**

* Authenticate using TopStepX API key
* Define symbol = `MGC`
* Define date range = Jan 1 → today
* Specify interval = 1-minute
* Retrieve all bars sequentially
* Store raw data in `parquet` or compressed JSON

### **4.1.4 Timezone Handling**

TopStep timestamps may be UTC → convert to **ET**.

---

# **4.2 Data Cleaning**

Processing steps:

1. Remove any duplicate timestamps
2. Forward-fill missing minute bars if needed
3. Convert to ET timezone
4. Ensure full continuity from 8 PM to 12 PM each day
5. Validate:

   * High ≥ max(Open, Close)
   * Low ≤ min(Open, Close)
   * No negative prices

---

# **4.3 Backtesting Architecture**

Structure:

### **4.3.1 Daily Loop**

For each trading day:

1. Extract data from 8 PM previous day → 12 PM current day
2. Build the Asian Range
3. At 3 AM create pending orders
4. Simulate order fills
5. Manage position (SL, BE, TP)
6. Exit at 12 PM ET if still open

---

# **4.3.2 Order Simulation Rules**

Stop entry logic:

* If price trades through stop level, mark entry at stop price

Stop loss logic:

* Triggered when low/high crosses SL

TP logic:

* Triggered when high/low crosses TP

Break-even logic:

* Once the trade reaches +1R, modify SL = entry price

---

# **4.4 Performance Metrics**

Track:

* Win rate
* Average R per trade
* Max drawdown
* Long-side vs short-side performance
* Average Asian range size
* Profit factor
* Sharpe ratio (optional)
* Expectancy per trade

---

# **5. Final Output of Backtest**

The results should include:

* Year-to-date (YTD) equity curve
* Trade list with timestamps
* Summary statistics
* Distribution of daily ranges
* Number of trades taken
* Distribution of winners and losers
* Percentage of days with breakout

For visual confirmation:

* Plot Asian range boxes each day
* Mark breakout entries
* Mark hit of TP, SL, or BE

---

# **6. Future Live Trading Plan**

The same logic will be ported to a real-time engine using:

* Streaming MGC data
* Automated range calculation
* Order placement at 3 AM
* Automatic break-even adjustment
* Automatic close at 12 PM
* Discord alert integration

---

# **7. Conclusion**

This document provides a fully specified, production-grade design for building the Asian Range Breakout Strategy for MGC futures. It is engineered to be 1:1 faithful to the strategy rules described earlier, ensures data accuracy, enforces proper risk management, and creates a foundation for both backtesting and eventual live integration with the TopStep environment.

Next step (upon your instruction): implement the full Python backtester and provide the results for this year so far.
